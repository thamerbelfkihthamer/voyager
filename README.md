# Voyager

Voyager is a Chrome app designed to connect learners with educational,
inspirational, and aspirational content from around the world.

Voyager is designed to work on Chromebooks, and will evolve to be responsive
to other platforms. When it comes to education, Voyager is meant to be a
stepping stone, not a final destination. It is meant to excite and ignite while
preparing learners to explore beyond Voyager’s boundaries.
